# Design Pattern with JavaScript




- Design patterns are typically split into three categories
- This is called <em>**Gamma Categorization**</em> after Erich gamma, one of GoF authors
- **Creational Patterns**
    - Deal with the creation (constuction) of objects
    - Explicit (constructor) vs. implicit (DI,reflection, etc.)
    - Wholesale (single statement) vs piecewise (step-by-step)
- **Struction Patterns**
    - Concerned with the structure (e.g., class members)
    - Many  are wrappers that mimic the underlying class' interface
    - Stress the importance of good API design
- **Behavioral Patterns**
    - They are all different; no central theme
