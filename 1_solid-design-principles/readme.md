# Revisiting SOLID Design Principle


- **Single Responsibility Principle**
    - A class should have only one reason to change
     - <em>Separation of concerns</em> - different classes handling different, independent tasks/problems.
- **Open-Closed Principle**
    - Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
- **Liskov Substition Principle**
    - You should be able to substiute a base type for a subtype
- **Interface Segregation Principle**
    - Don't put too much into an interface; split into separate interfaces
    - <b><em>YAGNI</em></b> - You Ain't Going to Need It
- Dependency Inversion Principle 
    - High-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones;use abstractions
